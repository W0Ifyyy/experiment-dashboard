## Hi!

This is my first attempt to build fullstack application with Next.js

## Idea

I want to make a website with basic signup-login logic wher user can see their data like username etc, if user is a admin they can see a table of users that are registered on a website, and they can modify their permissions and even delete them from website, i hope i will build it without any large issues.
